##Hi there, welcome to **Nihaldhara**'s main page and introduction. 
I am a 19 year old exchange student in Seoultech, South Korea. 
Originally living in France, finally being able to taste delicious food, in quantity, for cheap, makes me want to never go back home.

* 🔭 I am currently working on my range of _programming_ skills
* 🌱 I am currently learning **Java**, **Markdown**, **Python** and **Korean**
* 🖌️ The banner above this text is a famous piece of art called *le Désespéré*, painted by **Gustave Courbet**, french artist
